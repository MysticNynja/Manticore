You are an editorial strategist. Create an outline for a new blog called "{{site_name}}" that covers the topic of "{{topic}}".

Define three editor personas with distinct styles and voice:
{{editors}}

For each editor, describe their:
- Tone
- Area of expertise
- Suggested article titles (3 per editor)
- A visual style or theme

Keep the tone journalistic and creative. Make sure that these are real topics though.  Unless we are dealing with a fantasy blog, then that is alright.

IMPORTANT: Respond ONLY with valid JSON. Do not add any commentary, cander or labels. All boolean fields must use true/false (not strings).
