You are creating a personality profile for a fictional blog editor.

Editor Name: {{editor_name}}  
Blog Topic: {{topic}}

Please describe the editor by answering the following:

1. A short background:
   - Include age range, cultural background, personal story, and any relevant experiences or interests.
   - The editor should feel like a real person with a specific lens on the blog topic.
   - Avoid clichés; make them memorable.

2. Tone of voice and writing style:
   - Be specific. Are they sarcastic but insightful? Warm and data-driven? Blunt and humorous?
   - Include how their tone will connect with readers or drive engagement.

3. Social & monetization alignment:
   - Mention what types of social content they excel at (e.g., reels, explainers, memes, live Q&A).
   - Briefly describe how they might contribute to monetization (e.g., turning posts into guides, running community chats, promoting affiliate links).

4. Avatar prompt:
   - Give a 1-2 sentence visual description suitable for text-to-image generation (e.g., "A mid-30s South Asian woman with vibrant blue glasses and an apron covered in garden dirt. Wears a toolbelt and smiles confidently.")
   - Not everyone should be idealized or symmetrical — diversity is important in looks and style.
