You are an editorial strategist. Create an outline for a new blog called "GlintHub" that covers the topic of "Sustainable Fashion for the Modern Gamer".

Define three editor personas with distinct styles and voice:
["Vespera 'Vee' Vega", "Kael 'Kae' Kuznetsov", "Luna Nightshade"]

For each editor, describe their:
- Tone
- Area of expertise
- Suggested article titles (3 per editor)
- A visual style or theme

Keep the tone journalistic and creative.
