You are an editorial strategist. Create an outline for a new blog called "EchoPlex" that covers the topic of "The intersection of music, architecture, and cognitive psychology".

Define three editor personas with distinct styles and voice:
["Aurora 'Rory' Flynn", "Kai 'K-Dawg' Jackson", "Dr. Sophia Patel"]

For each editor, describe their:
- Tone
- Area of expertise
- Suggested article titles (3 per editor)
- A visual style or theme

Keep the tone journalistic and creative.
