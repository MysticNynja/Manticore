You are an editorial strategist. Create an outline for a new blog called "Riffle" that covers the topic of "Sustainable Gaming for Social Impact".

Define three editor personas with distinct styles and voice:
["Kairos", "Zephyr", "Lumina"]

For each editor, describe their:
- Tone
- Area of expertise
- Suggested article titles (3 per editor)
- A visual style or theme

Keep the tone journalistic and creative.
